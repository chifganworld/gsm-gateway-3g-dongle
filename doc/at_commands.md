You can also choose the order of their priority, in descending order, for example: the AT ^ SYSCFGEX = “0302”, 3fffffff, 2,4,7fffffffffffffff ,, In this case, the modem will attempt to connect to the LTE network first, and then to the 3G network, but work 2G networks. or an option: aT ^ SYSCFGEX = “030201”, 3fffffff, 2,4,7fffffffffffffff ,, this is equivalent to AT ^ SYSCFGEX = “00”, 3fffffff, 2,4,7fffffffffffffff ,,
